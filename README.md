# Prompt-Library
Purpose of project:

The purpose of this project is to open-source a comprehensive library of pre-validated, security-focused AI prompts populated by Netskope. By releasing this project, we are inviting other security teams to test out prompts that the Netskope security team is actively using for our own internal operations. This initiative positions us as transparent innovators and allows other security teams to immediately leverage our internal tradecraft.

Purpose of Prompt Library:

Unlike our framework, this repository provides actionable text inputs that security analysts across any department can use to streamline daily operations. Its purpose is to act as a direct productivity booster, allowing them to visit the repository, find a specific use case, and implement it immediately by simply copying, pasting, and executing. These "recipes" help anyone get more value out of the models and tools they use on a daily basis.

What problem are we trying to solve:

The problem we are solving is the "blank page problem". We have already done the trial-and-error work, ensuring that security professionals can skip the guesswork and get effective answers from their AI tools on day one. 

Our goals for this Prompt Library:

Our goal is to drive widespread adoption by providing free, open-source "recipes" that support the entire security industry. We aim to demonstrate the advanced expertise embedded within the Netskope ecosystem while transforming this repository into a living knowledge base where we collectively define the best techniques for querying AI across every security department, task, and use case.

For Contributors:

We are fostering a collaboration between Netskope and the security community and explicitly encourage all security teams to upload and share their own effective prompts. Because this library spans multiple security departments, we need experts from each team to contribute and validate content. We envision the community sharing best practices to help ensure prompts remain accurate, effective, and free of company-sensitive or confidential information.

- All of our prompts are structured using the prompt sharing framework, which can be found here: https://github.com/netskopeoss/Prompt-Sharing-Framework


Policy Notice: 

Keep it secure! 🔒 Do NOT upload prompts containing or that rely on confidential, internal-only, or sensitive data. Ensure all inputs are free of Netskope confidential information before submitting as it will not be accepted or allowed.
